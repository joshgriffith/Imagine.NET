## Introduction
Imagine.NET is a .NET Core library for the generation and transformation of data using OpenAI's GPT API. Imagine makes it easy to seamlessly work with .NET types and data structures. GPT's excellent zero-shot semantic understanding and completion enables powerful data processing paradigms that this library is optimized around.

## Why?
Most software works with structured data with known types at compile-time. Unfortunately, it can be challenging to get such structured data in and out of GPT prompt chains. Imagine.NET lets you focus on describing your domain model in a fluent and declarative manner that is both familiar and productive. This project is used to power the 'imagination' and reasoning of AI agents like Cheevly (www.cheevly.com).
